Golf Universe Website

I created a golf equipment website using Bootstrap and JavaScript. This website includes a home page, shoppping page and contact page. The navigation bar has usuable links to help navigate the web pages. The nav bar transitions into a collasped dropbox on smaller screens with the use of Bootstrap. The header on the home page has a "click me" button that activates a pop up message when clicked on. There are three cards on the home page that include any deals or special offerings. Each card has a clickable button that will navigate the user to the related page. Some CSS was used to add to the desired look of the home page.

The shop page includes 3 tables tables separated by category. Bootstrap was used to add color, design, and a hover effect when hovering over the table rows. 

The contact page is a form styled with Bootstrap. There is an input field for email, comments/description and a checkbox to sign up for the email list. There is a button to submit and store the data.

I added functionality to my webpage by using JavaScript. My first function greets the user with a pop up message when the "click me" button is selected. I have a function that calculates the total price of items purchased. There is a function that applies a 20% discount to all items during a sale. The last function stores the Comments/Description message from the contact page.
